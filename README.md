# Gold Medal Metrics â€“ Olympic Data Reporting Web Application

### Overview


This comprehensive project integrates Java with Spring Boot and SQL for backend functionality, while incorporating JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for frontend UI/UX development. This project is designed to manage and present gold medal data for various countries. It includes models to represent data objects, interface repositories to interact with these models, and an SQL database to store the objects. Additionally, this project's Spring Boot application is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to gold medal data for countries - it provides endpoints to fetch lists of countries, detailed country information, and country-specific gold medal data. The project interacts with repositories for country, gold medal data and its attributes, processes requests for sorting and filtering, and generates appropriate JSON responses for clients.
